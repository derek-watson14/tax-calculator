# tax-calculator
A single page web application built with only JavaScript, HTML and CSS that allows a user to input their income and have their estimated tax burden printed

I created this project to help me win an internet argument about increasing tax rates on earners of over $10M per year.
It was originally just a js file but I later addded a simple UI for personal use.

I also learned that no one wins internet arguments.
